# hello-world
this a test to see how to create a new repository to see if it works. test beta 1
to see if the youtube video im going to start to create this new repository to finally be able to follow along with the video.
this is the first test on my own to finally be able to understand the concept im learning about.
this new branch is so im able to clone on my computer from my terminal station , on the command line, this is going to be great.
so my computer is not letting me do all the git branch commands now i don't know what is going on but this is so frustating.
it apopears that im not being able to memorize all the contect im recieving.
